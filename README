Dispatch is a resourceful router and request handler structure for Node.js.  Handles
requests placed in its request queue, which in the future can be extended to a worker-based
distributed system for resource-based elastic capacity scaling.

Structure:
- router.js - the router and path generator; paths exportable via browserify bify.append(router.path.toString());
- controller.js - the controller base class
- render.js - template rendering, today based on Jade, that provides helpers & other goodies
  - helpers -- (available during rendering) - in the examples directory
- examples - these are full examples of how to use dispatch in an actual project

To-do items (in rough priority order):
- improvements to render, redirect, etc to be more full-featured
- select 3rd party inheritance structure or keep rolling our own?
- generalize away from Jade to allowing pluggable templates

Development:
- Install Coffeescript, jshint and vows
- cake hint, cake spec should pass
